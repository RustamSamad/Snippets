# Chatbot Snippets

Here you can find a list of snippets and chatbots backups that you can restore back into your Xenioo account for testing and experimenting.

## [Dynamic Data Colors](https://github.com/xenioo/Snippets/tree/master/Chatbots/Dynamic%20Data)

This chatbot shows how to use the API action in order to create a dynamic reply from the chatbot.

## [XML Soap Service](https://github.com/xenioo/Snippets/tree/master/Chatbots/XML%20SOAP)

This chatbot shows how to use the usual API action to interact and retrieve data from a standard XML SOAP service. In this example you can see how to manipulate XML content by both extracting specific nodes values from the API call using XPath standard query language or by extracting a JSON object model by using Xenioo cloud scripting functions.

## [Facebook Ads](https://github.com/xenioo/Snippets/tree/master/Chatbots/Facebook%20Ads)

This example illustrates how to connect a specific Xenioo behaviour of your chatbot to a Facebook Advertising button. By connecting directly to a specific behaviour, you can have your Facebook Advertising start a very specific section of your chatbot when interacted.
