Web Chat Widget supports text formatting.

Just surround text used in any Content Action with the following tags:

## Italic

To italicize your message, place an underscore on both sides of the text, like so:

*\_text\_*

## Bold
To bold your message, place an asterisk on both sides of the text, like so:

**\*text\***

## Strikethrough
To strikethrough your message, place a tilde on both sides of the text, like so:

~~\~text\~~~
