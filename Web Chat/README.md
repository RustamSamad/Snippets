# Web Chat Samples

This folder contains various javascript examples related to the Xenioo Web Chat Channel initialization, configuration and interaction with your page. Check the list below for a brief explanation of each example

# initialize_with_variables
This simple initialization file contains a small variation of the standard script that will initialize your chatbot conversation by injecting a variable. As the new conversation starts, the variable is automatically valued and can be used right away. If the injected variable does not exist, it will be created.
By injecting variables from the page, you can for example tell your chatbot the currently logged username, the contents of the current shopping cart or the current page info so that it can give meaningful and contextual information.
